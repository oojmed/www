          <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the

          the United Kingdom, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
          <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
          considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held
          to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these
          Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
          between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior

          <h3>Changes</h3>
          <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms
          at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days
          notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material
          change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
          <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become
          effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to
          the new terms, please stop using the Service.</p>
